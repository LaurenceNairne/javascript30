# js30-01-drumkit
#### The first of many Javascript 30 projects. It is a simple application where the user presses a key on the standard US/UK QWERTY keyboard on the A-L row, and a drumkit sound plays.

Covers:
- Usage of CSS classes in JS
- Adding and removing event listeners
- Using 'transitionend' events to undo CSS class changes
- Creation of const variables (though outside reading educated me on the definition)
- Using classList property on an element to add and remove classes
